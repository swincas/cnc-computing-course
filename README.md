# cnc-computing-course
Content for the CAS Cookies-n-Code Computing Course (CN5)
* yes, the slides are pretty full... this is because this repo shall (alongside course material) mainly serve as a resource to find useful information

## TODO
- [ ] [session3_02_interactive_computing/](./content/session3_02_interactive_computing/)
    - [ ] jupyter on ozstar

## Notes

### Installable Parts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> the [cn5_pkg](./cn5_pkg/) is installable.
> This way you can use the utility functions easily in your own scripts.

* the [cn5_pkg](./cn5_pkg/) package contains functions used across diferent sessions in the cn5 course

* To install simply call the following from within your virtual environment:
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/swincas/cnc-computing-course.git
```
* You can then use the function as usual:
```python
from cn5_pkg import cn5
cn5.runtime_estimate(<args>)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you find the [cn5_pkg](./cn5_pkg/) package useful for your work, a brief acknowledgement would be appreciated:
> We/I acknowledge the Cookie Monsters from the Swinburne Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomping (CAS), who made their utility functions available on github (https://github.com/swincas/cnc-computing-course.git).

### For Cookie Monsters (Presenters)
* to use the custom [cn5_style.css](./styles/cn5_style.css) in the [marpit](https://marpit.marp.app/) slides proceed as follows
    1. open project in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    2. add [Marp for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) addon
    3. open workspace settings
    4. search for `marp theme`
    5. under `Markdown â€º Marp: Themes` add the following path `styles/cn5_style.css`
* when presenting it is useful to enable `screencast mode`
    * enable via `ctrl+shift+P > Developer: Toggle Screencast Mode`
    * ensures people can see your keystrokes
